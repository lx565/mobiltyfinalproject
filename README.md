## Abstract
In the year 2004, Professor John Rice and Dr. Erik van Zwet claimed that linear model was the most effective and simple method to predict future travel time given current status travel time and the historical mean of travel time, compared other method like PCA and Nearest Neighbors. They claimed that the satisfying empirical result of the linear model with RMSE less than 10 minutes using PeMS data. In this work, I re-examined the linear model with a different dataset from PeMS and I also applied Gaussian Process Method for inference. After I conducted various complex data cleansing and data transformation procedures, I discovered that the empirical result of the linear model could be largely improved by adding past hoursâ€™ travel time as a feature of the linear model. As a result, the RMSE of the new linear method can be reduced to 5 minutes from 10 minutes for 60 minutes lag.
